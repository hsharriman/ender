## TODO

- [x] Update page layout
- [x] Given + Prove rows
- [x] Add reasons
- [x] render minis
- [x] add "relies on"
- [x] add focus to aspects of diagram
- [x] Step-by-step interaction instead of grid
- [x] Dynamically updating the styling of objects based on interaction
- [x] Interaction between text of proof and visualization
- [x] Fix proof row highlighting based on dependencies
- [x] Add better keyboard controls and scroll
- [x] Fix label sizes and placement
- [x] Make angle markers look less scuffed
- [x] Make parallel markers face the same direction
- [x] Handle multiple tick marks on the same object
- [x] long-form layout + resampling
- [x] make linked text active on hover
- [x] hovering not working on correct figs in long form
- [x] Right angle tick marks
- [x] relies on for long-form
- [x] reword the reasons to follow if/then pattern
- [x] CSS animations for transitions
- [x] Static format
- [x] automate multiple format creation
- [x] fix layout of long-form
- [x] make symbols bigger in linkedtext
- [ ] Improve the proof class structure / cleanup (always ongoing)
- [ ] be able to render points
- [ ] add prev/next buttons to navigate through
- [ ] define order for pilot
- [ ] highlighting angles on hover? when no tick is visible

## Stretch TODOs

- [ ] question logic/randomizing
- [ ] multiple choice question component
- [ ] redo relies on for long-form
- [ ] minifigures highlight on hover as well (for key terms)
- [ ] Change fonts (again?)
- [ ] highlighting of text when clicking on the diagram
- [ ] check for segments that overlap or are sub-sections of larger segment + keep track (then fix complete proof 3)

## Less Urgent Bugs

- [ ] fix tick mark placement for angles in minifigures
- [ ] Make relies on resample if screen resizes
- [ ] go through todos in files
- [ ] hovering on point in long-form highlights wrong diagram label
- [ ] Make it so that hovering text doesn't cause the text to move

## TODO for infra/study

- [ ] anonymized ID for each participant
- [ ] uploading selected answers

## TODO for future proofs

- Circles
